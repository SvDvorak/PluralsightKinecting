# PluralsightKinecting
Code written during Pluralsight meetup at Bouvet

No strict plan but suggested features are:
* Person picking up other objects, for example when closing hand near it
* Cube heads with image, maybe random image taken from Facebook profile?
* Gesture recognition of hand movements
